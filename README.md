### Overview ###

Wildlife biologist currently use Radio-telemetry to obtatain information on the movement of a focal species. Radio-telementry is a very effective tool however the procedure assosiated with its usage is very ineffient. A typical tracking procedure would go as follows:
*A large metal anntena connected to a VHF radio telemetry transmitter is taken into the field 
*The range of the transmitter is set to the max and the anntena is pointed in all directions until a beep is heard
*The researches head in that direction and decrease the range 
**This process is repeated unitil the animal is found**



Typically  is used to track down the focal species, the anntenna is pointed   
onto  and can inﬂuence the behavior of the animal when frequent measurements are required. 


Oftentimes, the main limitation to widespread application of this technology is the cost,which can dictate the number of individuals outﬁtted with GPS technology, thereby limitingsample sizes. Here, we discuss the development of a low-cost, customizable, open-source hard-ware GPS logger for use in animal movement studies. 

### Hardware Description ###

The Logger is made up of 3 major components; an Arduino Pro Mini, GPSRM module, Lithion-ion battery and a custom designed PCB responsible for powering peripherals and storing data.

The components were aranged to minimize the height of the logger to reduce its footprint.
Black Heat shink tubing was used to protect and water proof the logger
